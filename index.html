            <p id = "bio">Dara Anya graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2016. He graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Neuroscience with a focus in psychology. Following his graduation, Dara started pursuing his passion for filmmaking. He made his directorial and actorial debut with his narrative short film: <i>Forced To Swim</i>. His short was nominated for "Best Experimental/Art-house/Silent Short" and "Best Original Music" in the Southern States Indie FanFilmFest 2017 selection. Since, Dara has created an experimental short film: <i>Natural Beauty</i>. His love for storytelling drives his pursuit of a career in the film and entertainment industry. His goal is to produce works that present unique perspectives to challenge the audience.<br> <br> Dara's interest in the effects of neurochemistry on human behavior and the influence of an individual's expereinces, guided his decision to major in neuroscience. His main intersets were the effects of behavioral despair and depression. <i>Forced To Swim</i> is about a man, struggling to cope with his traumatic past, deciding whether or not to contunue living in a decaying world. The short was inspired by the eponymous experiment testing the effects of antidepressants on behavioral despair. <i>Natural Beauty</i> is about an individual who’s unable to cope with loss and develops bipolar depression. The goal of the film was to convey the theory that depression can be developed or triggered (due to the principle of neuroplasticity) by the abiding effects of a traumatic experience.</p>
